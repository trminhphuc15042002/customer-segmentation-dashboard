### 3. High-Potential Customer Segment (Income vs. Spending)
The most promising segment consists of customers with **high income but low spending behavior**.

- **High Income – Low Spending:** 415 customers  
- This is the **largest segment among high-income customers** who are currently under-spending.

**Business Implications & Recommendations:**
- This group has strong purchasing power but remains under-engaged.
- Instead of offering discounts:
  - Focus on **core value propositions**, product quality, and premium experiences.
  - Highlight **exclusivity, brand value, and superior service**.

  - Promote **fast and reliable delivery services**.
  - Combine products suitable for multiple age groups (e.g., children and adults).
